# DonationsCrawler
The use case for this is specific. I used it to compare two servers' donation statistics. Using the "Recent Donations" widget on their BuyCraft website and indexing the store items and prices, I was able to get a pretty good estimate on how much money each server was making. 

I compared a EULA compliant server and a non-EULA compliant server for some time by running this program on a cron job. The only dependency needed is [jsoup](http://www.jsoup.org).
